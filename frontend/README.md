# React FastAPI Application

This project is a full-stack application that combines a React frontend with a FastAPI backend. The frontend is built using React and serves as the user interface, while the backend is developed with FastAPI to handle API requests.

## Frontend

The frontend of the application is located in the `frontend` directory. It includes the following key files:

- **public/index.html**: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the React application.
- **public/favicon.ico**: The favicon for the web application.
- **src/App.js**: The main component that defines the structure and behavior of the app.
- **src/components/index.js**: Exports various React components used in the application.
- **src/index.js**: The entry point for the React application that renders the App component into the DOM.
- **src/styles/App.css**: Contains the CSS styles for the React application.
- **package.json**: Configuration file for npm, listing dependencies, scripts, and metadata.

## Backend

The backend of the application is located in the `backend` directory. It includes the following key files:

- **app/__init__.py**: Marks the directory as a Python package.
- **app/main.py**: The entry point for the FastAPI application, initializing the FastAPI app and setting up routes.
- **app/api/__init__.py**: Marks the directory as a Python package for API-related modules.
- **app/api/endpoints.py**: Defines the API endpoints for the FastAPI application.
- **app/models/__init__.py**: Marks the directory as a Python package for models.
- **app/models/models.py**: Defines the data models used in the FastAPI application.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies required for the FastAPI backend.

## Docker

The application can be containerized using Docker. The following files are included for Docker configuration:

- **Dockerfile**: Contains instructions for building the Docker image for the application.
- **docker-compose.yml**: Defines the services, networks, and volumes for the Docker application.

## Getting Started
